Installing and Running
======================

NOTE: This repository is for developers. If you are a regular user, you should 
refer to <https://plaimi.net/games/limbs-off/>.

General instructions
--------------------

Limbs Off uses the GNU build system. It can be successfully installed on most 
systems with:

$ autoreconf -i && ./configure && make && sudo make install

See INSTALL for more detailed instructions. Run the game with:

$ limbs-off

Gentoo
------

If you are on a Gentoo system you can install the game via the Sunrise 
overlay, or by downloading our ebuild, and using a local overlay.

To use Sunrise (recommended), refer to 
<http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml> to add the overlay.

Next are the instructions for using our ebuild in a local overlay (not 
recommended). (Skip this section if you are using Sunrise.) Skip steps where 
appropriate.

# mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/games-misc/limbs-off
# cd /usr/local/portage/games-misc/limbs-off
# wget https://secure.plaimi.net/games/limbs-off/limbs-off-9999.ebuild
# ebuild limbs-off-9999.ebuild digest
# echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/portage $PORTDIR_OVERLAY' >> /etc/make.conf

Limbs Off will likely be masked on your Gentoo system (if not, skip this 
section). This is because live ebuilds are considered dangerous. You need to 
unmask it. Refer to 
<http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=3&chap=3>. When 
you have done this, you can install Limbs Off.

# emerge limbs-off


You may then run the game via your desktop environment's menu, in the games 
section - or via a terminal emulator.

# limbs-off
